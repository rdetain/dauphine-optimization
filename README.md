Project : Linear regression methods comparison (Least Squares, Ridge and Lasso) with Python
-

Author : Rudy Detain  

The main purpose of this work is to compare linear regression methods (Least Squares, Ridge and Lasso) as solutions to the bias-variance trade-off problem. The database on which we will focus is a numerical database for superconducting materials, available here : https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Superconductivty+Data# 

A zero electrical resistance and expulsion of magnetic flux fields can be observed when a superconductor is cooled below its critical temperature. It could be interesting to use multiple regression to explain the critical temperature of a superconductor by some of its characteristics (number of elements, atomic mass, density, ...).
